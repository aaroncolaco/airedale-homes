“To be ill adjusted to a deranged world is not a breakdown.” 
― Jeanette Winterson

“Never give up on someone with a mental illness. When "I" is replaced by "We", illness becomes wellness.” 
― Shannon L. Alder

“One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.” 
― Friedrich Nietzsche

We believe you can have a mental illness and still be happy

You wake up every morning to fight the same demons that left you so tired the night before, and that, my love, is bravery.
